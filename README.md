# S_Dbw
S_Dbw validity index.
If you think the code is useful,please give me a star ^_^!

## description
The S_Dbw implemented here is suitable for evaluating the k-medoids clustering algorithm. The clustering center of the algorithm is different from k-means, which is a specific point. Therefore, some people want to use other clustering algorithms to evaluate, and need to modify the code slightly.
